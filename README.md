# Project Name: password_generator
# Description
This application was created to generate a random password based on criteria inputted by the user. Password security has never been more important than now, considering the rising frequency and sophistication of cyber security attacks. Secure passwords serve as the first line of defense in protecting data. This application would benefit any company or organization that needed to create unique user passwords to protect information. This application has mobile responsive built into the HTML with the meta tag: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /> The style.css sheet also included media query break points. In testing the screen size, I did not feel more was needed to improve the responsiveness of this application.
